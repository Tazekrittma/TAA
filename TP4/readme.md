# Unsupervised Learning Exploration: Clustering and Visualization

This code is part of an unsupervised learning exercise that explores various aspects of unsupervised learning. Here's an overview of what this code accomplishes:

1. Data Loading: The code loads a dataset of your choice from Kaggle or UCI.
2. Data Exploration: It conducts a thorough exploration of the dataset, including analyzing the number of features, generating descriptive statistics, and inspecting class distributions.
3. Dimensionality Reduction: The code employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dataset's dimensionality and visualize the data in two dimensions.
4. Clustering: It applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group data points based on their features and uses metrics to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. Visualization: The code visualizes the clusters obtained from K-Means using a 2D scatter plot.
6. Cluster Quality Evaluation: It evaluates the quality of the clusters using metrics such as inertia and silhouette score.

This exercise aims to understand unsupervised learning, its key differences from supervised learning, and the process of clustering data. It also covers techniques to select the optimal number of clusters, the importance of feature standardization, and the advantages and limitations of the K-Means algorithm. The quality of the clusters is assessed using relevant measures.
