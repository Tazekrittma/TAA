# Anomalie Detection and more! an exemple of Credit Card Fraud Detection with Isolation Forest

## Introduction

This repository contains code for detecting credit card fraud using the Isolation Forest algorithm. The dataset used for this exercise is sourced from Kaggle and includes credit card transactions, some of which are fraudulent.

## Dataset

- **Dataset:** [Credit Card Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:** Transactions of credit cards, with a subset labeled as fraudulent.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the code:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Make sure to install the required libraries.

2. **Load and Preprocess Data:** load the dataset, and preprocess the data.

3. **Train the Isolation Forest Model:** Train the model on the training dataset.

4. **Predict Anomalies:** Use the trained model to predict anomalies in the test dataset.

5. **Evaluate Model Performance:** Assess the model's performance by evaluating its predictions on the test data.

## Steps

1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load the dataset from Kaggle.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Isolation Forest model on the training data.
5. Predict anomalies on the test data.
6. Evaluate the model's performance.

## Note

Ensure you have the required permissions to access and use the Kaggle dataset.

Feel free to explore and enhance the code as needed. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
